# Church Auditing Department Report, 2023

**Role:** Managing Director, Church Auditing Department

<a name="p2"></a>Dear Brethren: Directed by revelation, as recorded in [section 120 of the Doctrine and Covenants](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/120?lang=eng), the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes—composed of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the Presiding Bishopric—authorizes the expenditure of Church funds. Church entities disburse funds in accordance with approved budgets, policies, and procedures.

<a name="p3"></a>Church Auditing, which consists of credentialed professionals and is independent of all other Church departments and entities, has responsibility to perform audits for the purpose of providing reasonable assurance regarding contributions received, expenditures made, and safeguarding of Church assets.

<a name="p4"></a>Based upon audits performed, Church Auditing is of the opinion that, in all material respects, contributions received, expenditures made, and assets of the Church for the year 2023 have been recorded and administered in accordance with Church\-approved budgets, accounting practices, and policies. The Church follows the practices taught to its members of living within a budget, avoiding debt, and saving against a time of need.

<a name="p5"></a>Respectfully submitted,

<a name="p6"></a>Church Auditing Department
